# Aaron's dotfiles.

These are my dotfiles for the zsh shell using [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

[mathias's readme](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/) is awesome. go read it.

This is a fork of [Paul Irish's dotfiles](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles), which is a fork of [mathias's](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/). However, since I'm using zsh and not bash, I've removed quite a few dotfiles.

## Dependancies and Niceties

Some dependancies and features that are nice to have are captured in `install-deps.sh` which adds homebrew, z, nave, etc. Run at your leisure.

## Syntax highlighting

â€¦is really important. even for these files.

Install [Dotfiles Syntax Highlighting](https://github.com/mattbanks/dotfiles-syntax-highlighting-st2) via [Sublime Text 2 Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)


### Sensible OS X defaults

```bash
./.osx
```
